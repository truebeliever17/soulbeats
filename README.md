# Soulbeats

Soulbeats is a music streaming platform, just like Spotify, Apple Music. It is a demo project for a DBMS course, so the project is quite raw. The main goal was to connect the database to the user interface.

P.S. If you are going to use the project's code for production, please note that there are security issues. For example, passwords are not encrypted and with the `GET /users` query, you can get all users' data with non-encrypted passwords, even if you are not in the system and do not have administrator rights.
